## A Finnish bakery's digital transformation journey ##
###### _By Mike Sulley_ ######

Elonen Oy is a bakery located in Jämsä, Finland. The company has been in operation since 1966 and has grown over the years to employ around 200 people. They produce a variety of baked goods, including cakes, breads, and cookies, which are sold in their own cafes and distributed to retailers throughout Finland.

In 2017, Elonen expanded its distribution to a national level, leading to increased demand for its products. As the business grew, Elonen implemented various IT and automation systems to support its bakery processes. However, despite collecting a significant amount of data, the company was not effectively utilizing it for decision-making.

To address this challenge, Elonen's CEO, Jari Elonen, reached out to Pasi Korpela at IBM for assistance. Korpela suggested exploring digital transformation and leveraging data to enhance the customer experience. Elonen was then advised to consult with Houston Analytics Oy, a Finnish analytics company specializing in retail and packaged goods.

Instead of tackling all the issues at once, Elonen, IBM, and Houston Analytics agreed to solve problems individually, one at a time, building upon proven benefits. The first problem they focused on was the manual and time-consuming process of printing and sorting product labels before shipping. The bakery faced difficulties in connecting product and customer data stored in separate, outsourced databases during the packaging and shipping process, leading to shipping delays.

By working together, Elonen, IBM, and Houston Analytics aimed to automate and streamline this particular step in the packaging process. This approach allowed Elonen to gradually improve efficiency and competitiveness while leveraging the data they had collected.
