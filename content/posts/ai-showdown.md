## AI Showdown: AWS vs Azure vs GCP ##
###### _By Mike Sulley_ ######

We are comparing AI products from major cloud providers so that every can make an informed decision when it comes to deploying AI centric solutions.

### Azure AI Services ###

Azure Cognitive Services: Azure offers a range of pre-built AI models and APIs through Azure Cognitive Services. These services cover various domains, such as vision, speech, language, and decision-making. Examples include Computer Vision, Speech to Text, Language Understanding (LUIS), and Text Analytics. Azure Cognitive Services are designed to be easily integrated into applications and services.

Azure Machine Learning: Azure Machine Learning (AML) provides a comprehensive platform for building, training, deploying, and managing machine learning models. It supports a variety of frameworks and tools, allowing developers and data scientists to experiment with different algorithms and workflows. AML also offers automated machine learning capabilities to simplify model development.

### AWS AI Services ###

Amazon Rekognition: Amazon Rekognition is an image and video analysis service that offers capabilities like object and scene detection, facial analysis, celebrity recognition, and text recognition. It can be used for applications such as content moderation, facial recognition, and sentiment analysis.

Amazon Polly: Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech service that enables developers to convert text into lifelike speech. It supports multiple languages and offers various voices to choose from. Polly can be integrated into applications, devices, and services to provide natural-sounding speech output.

Amazon SageMaker: Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It provides a range of tools and infrastructure to streamline the end-to-end machine learning process. SageMaker supports popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch and offers capabilities for distributed training and hyperparameter optimization.

### Google Cloud AI Services ###

Google Cloud Vision AI: Google Cloud Vision AI offers powerful image analysis capabilities, including object detection, image labeling, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and content moderation. It allows developers to integrate these features into their applications, making it easier to extract insights from images.

Google Cloud Speech-to-Text: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text enables developers to convert spoken language into written text. It supports real-time and batch transcription and offers features like speaker diarization, punctuation, and profanity filtering. This service can be useful for applications like transcription services and voice assistants.

Google Cloud AutoML: Google Cloud AutoML is a suite of machine learning tools that aim to simplify the model development process. It provides an interface for automating certain steps of the machine learning pipeline, such as data preparation, feature engineering, and model training. AutoML also includes specific services like AutoML Vision and AutoML Natural Language for domain-specific tasks.
